# a mathematical model of the human ventricular myocyte (ten Tusscher & Panfilov, Am J Physiol 291: H1088â€“H1100, 2006) was programmed in CUDA, a programming language for graphics processors. Taking advantage of the parallel hardware, cell computations are completed on the GPU by many threads running simultaneously. Additionally, different simulations of the model are executed in parallel.
